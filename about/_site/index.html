<p>I am a Research Engineer at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com"><strong>IBM T J Watson Research Center</strong></a> in New York , where I work in the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/healthcare/"><strong>HealthCare Analytics Research Group</strong></a> . Previously, I was a Quantitative Researcher in the <a href="http://www.maizegenetics.net"><strong>Buckler Lab @ Cornell University</strong></a>, where I worked on the problems in bioinformatics and genomics.
<br /><br />
My research interests are in mathematics, machine learning, data visualization, Human Computer Interaction and computational sciences (physics, biology).
<br /><br />
I was born and raised in Northern India. I hold a Masters in Theoretical Physics from <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a> in the UK, where I studied string theory and black holes in higher dimensions. I dropped out from mathematics PhD program (after 3 years) at <a href="https://www.ksu.edu">Kansas State University</a>”. At K-State, I studied Donaldson-Thomas Invariants and their wall crossing phenomenon. I worked with <a href="http://www.math.ksu.edu/~soibel/">Yan Soibelman</a>.
<br /><br />
It was at K-State that I started exploring machine learning and data science. I took courses in machine learning, information retrieval, text mining and worked at <a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~dcaragea/mlb/doku.php">Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Lab, K-State</a>.
<br /><br />
I have held research positions at <a href="http://www.isid.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute - Delhi</a>, <a href="http://www.theory.tifr.res.in">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Mumbai</a>, and at <a href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in">JN Center for Advanced Scientific Research - Bangalore</a>.
<br /><br />
I am a voracious reader and an avid traveler. I hang out at the local coffee shops, which serve as my office away from office. I write about my readings, travels and adventures with caffeine at <a href="http://januverma.tumblr.com/"><strong>Blog of Small Things</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time on <a href="https://www.quora.com/Janu-Verma-2"><strong>Quora</strong></a> consuming contents on a various topics. I answer questions related to Bioinformatics, String Theory, advance Mathematics (Differential Geometry) and Machine Learning. Feel free to ask me questions!
