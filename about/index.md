I am a Research Engineer at [**IBM T J Watson Research Center**](http://www.research.ibm.com) in New York , where I work in the [**HealthCare Analytics Research Group**](http://www.research.ibm.com/healthcare/) . Previously, I was a Quantitative Researcher in the [**Buckler Lab @ Cornell University**](http://www.maizegenetics.net), where I worked on the problems in bioinformatics and genomics.
<br><br>
My research interests are in mathematics, machine learning, data visualization, Human Computer Interaction and computational sciences (physics, biology).
<br><br>
I was born and raised in Northern India. I hold a Masters in Theoretical Physics from [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) in the UK, where I studied string theory and black holes in higher dimensions. I dropped out from mathematics PhD program (after 3 years) at [Kansas State University](https://www.ksu.edu)". At K-State, I studied Donaldson-Thomas Invariants and their wall crossing phenomenon. I worked with [Yan Soibelman](http://www.math.ksu.edu/~soibel/).
<br><br>
It was at K-State that I started exploring machine learning and data science. I took courses in machine learning, information retrieval, text mining and worked at [Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Lab, K-State](http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~dcaragea/mlb/doku.php).
<br><br>
I have held research positions at [Indian Statistical Institute - Delhi](http://www.isid.ac.in/), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - Mumbai](http://www.theory.tifr.res.in), and at [JN Center for Advanced Scientific Research - Bangalore](http://www.jncasr.ac.in).
<br><br>
I am a voracious reader and an avid traveler. I hang out at the local coffee shops, which serve as my office away from office. I write about my readings, travels and adventures with caffeine at [**Blog of Small Things**](http://januverma.tumblr.com/).

I spend a lot of time on [**Quora**](https://www.quora.com/Janu-Verma-2) consuming contents on a various topics. I answer questions related to Bioinformatics, String Theory, advance Mathematics (Differential Geometry) and Machine Learning. Feel free to ask me questions!
