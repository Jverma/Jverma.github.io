My research revolves around mathematics, machine learning with applications in sciences, and data visualization.

# Mathematics and Theoretical Physics

- **Black Holes**: For my masters I studied black holes in higher dimensions and the holography principle (AdS/CFT). I submitted a dissertation at University of Cambridge on these topics.
- **Calabi-Yau manifolds**: For my PhD studies, I focussed on Calabi-Yau manifolds and their mirror symmetry. I studied Donaldson-Thomas invariants of CY manifolds and their relation with black holes in string theory.


# Computational Biology

- **[TASSEL]((http://www.maizegenetics.net/#!tassel/c17q9))**: TASSEL is a software package (JAVA) to evaluate traits associations, evolutionary patterns, and linkage disequilibrium. I implementated a machine learning based data imputa- tion module, linear algberaic operations (e.g. SVD), weighted mixed linear model for GWAS, and a trie based retrival system for barcodes in GBS pipeline. 
- **Cassava Genetic Load project**: This project is funded by Gates Foundation. I implemented, evaluated, and compared pipelines for calling variants, and genome assembly. The prelimanary results from my work were presented at Plant and Anomal Genomics, 2015. Work is in progress to build the next generation HapMap for Cassava. Paper under preparation.
- **[Visualizing genomic annotations](https://github.com/Jverma/Visualizing-genome-annotations)**: Built a framework for creating D3 JavaScrpt interactive visualtion of genome feature file (gff). It creates an interactive, collapsible, tree for a chosen segment of genome, with mouseover features.

# Cosmology

- **Non linear matter power spectrum**: Studied the applicability of machine learning predictive modeling to estimate the matter power spectrum. [Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04622) is under review at Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 

# Other fun projects

- **[Saransh](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~jv291/summarize/)**: It is a text summarization webapp. Used text mining techniques like tf-idf vectors, graphical algorithms, and statistical NLP methods to extract most informative sentences from the text.
